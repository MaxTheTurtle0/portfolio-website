# Simple Portfolio Website

### Description
This is a static website built without any frameworks, that I first built because I wanted to first learn how to build a website without any frameworks. By now I decided to create a website that isn't just my portfolio, but also a blog and maybe more in the future. That's why I decided to leave this repository public as a template for anyone who wants to build a simple portfolio website without any frameworks. 

### How to use it for yourself
1. Clone the repository
2. Change the content of the `index.html` file to your own content
3. Add your own images to the `img` folder if you need any
That's it! You can now host your website on any static hosting service.
