        <p>
            I am a 16-year-old student living in Germany. My passion is programming, and I am currently taking the CS50x course, which is helping me expand my knowledge and skills in computer science. Additionally, I am focusing on learning Python and exploring various GUI frameworks.

        <h3>unit-converter</h3>
        <p>
            My first project was a simple unit converter that I made using Python and the Customtkinter. It converts between various units of length, weight, temperature, volume and pressure.
